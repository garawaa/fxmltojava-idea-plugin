# fxmltojava-idea-plugin
fxml to java converter intellij plugin.
Sometimes you may meet trouble with fxml files like me. For example fxml based javafx applications are difficult to obfuscate. 
This problem can be solved by converting fxml files to java code.
For this purpose I implemented this small plugin. Currently it only supported until intellij 2020.2 version.
You also can freely use it.
## Build tools:
Intellij IDE Community 2020.1.4
JDK 8

Thank you.
