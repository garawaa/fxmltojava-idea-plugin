fxml to java converter intellij plugin
Sometimes you may meet trouble with fxml files like me. For example fxml based javafx applications are difficult to obfuscate. 
This problem can be solved by converting fxml files to java code.
For this purpose I implemented this small plugin.
You also can freely use it.
Thank you.
